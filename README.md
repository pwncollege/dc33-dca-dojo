# Defcon 33 Defcon Academy Dojo

This repository is for challenges specific to the Defcon 33 Defcon Academy space.

This is a great place to commit any demo challenges and demo source!

- If a challenge is intended to exist outside DCA, please import it from the source dojo.
- Please do not reimport entire existing modules (ex: importing Assembly Crash course).

If you have a cool one-off challenge you'd like to showcase, even if it's not immediately applicable to a talk topic, consider adding here as a fun challenge for more experienced attendees to tackle.

If you are unsure how to add content to the dojo, please ask for help!
