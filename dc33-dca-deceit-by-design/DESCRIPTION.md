Some exploits aren’t about brute force — they’re about perfect timing.
In this session, you’ll dive into race conditions and Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities, where a well-timed move can sidestep even the most careful validation.
Learn how to detect these subtle flaws, how to weaponize them, and how attackers win by being just a few microseconds ahead.
With live demonstrations and hands-on challenges, you’ll gain the reflexes needed to exploit the gap before the system catches on.
