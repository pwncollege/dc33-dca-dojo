Modern processors are built for speed, but in doing so, they make dangerous assumptions.
The very features that make processors fast can also make them untrustworthy.
This talk explores how features like speculative and out-of-order execution open the door to powerful side-channel attacks like Spectre and Meltdown.
You’ll learn how these vulnerabilities allow attackers to read privileged memory, bypass isolation, and leak secrets that should never be exposed.
Through clear explanations and live demonstrations, we’ll show how trust in hardware can be misplaced and how those lies can be turned into exploits.
